C - Simple Shell

This is our group project to build our own simple_shell.
We are going to work on this project in a pair of two; Kwizera Egide and Hafsa Yussuf.
Iam from Rwanda and my partner Hafsa is from Kenya.
Below is a description of what each file does.
hsh - The object file for the shell program.
shell.c - The source file for the core logic of the simple shell program.
shell.h - The prototype source file for the simple shell program.
Compile with the following gcc flags - gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c shell.h -o hsh
After compilation has run successfully with gcc, run the program with ./hsh in the linux terminal.
